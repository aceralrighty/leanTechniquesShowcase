this was actually more complicated than i initially thought. Had to remember what modulus was. but basically, in my python script i have a method that takes in the amount from the user, while validating that it isn't empty and all that good stuff. Then I had to figure out that i needed to convert what the user inputs into cents, so I created a method that does just that. then making change for the user was the hardest for me, I learned about an operator called Floor division in python from w3schools which is what i used to find the dollar amount for each dollar. so for example if i wanted to know how many 10 dollar bills are in $20.00 it returns 2 because that's how many 10 dollar bills fit into without any remainder, another example if i have 19.99 it only returns one 10 dollar bill because that's how many fit into 19.99 without remainders. after that, I calculate the remainder. You can see this work in the method. Then I check how many from each I have, it shows how many i have of each, even if it's zero. yes, it is in a lot of if statements, I tried other ways but this way made the most sense in my head.
